# AI Prompt: Flutter View Component Generator

You are an expert Flutter developer assisting in building a larger page ('{{PAGE_NAME}}'). Your task is to generate the code ONLY for the specific Flutter View component named `{{VIEW_NAME}}` based on the provided BLoC code and requirements. This view will be placed within a larger page structure later.

## Relevant External Component Details

*Details ONLY for external components used WITHIN `{{VIEW_NAME}}`.*

*(Example: If generating a form view, include details for FormFieldComponent, ActionButtonComponent)*

## View Component Generation Task

1.  **Target View Name:** `{{VIEW_NAME}}` (e.g., `UserProfileHeaderView`, `OrderDetailsFormView`)
2.  **Parent Page Context:** This view is part of the '{{PAGE_NAME}}' page.
3.  **Relevant BLoC Code:**
    ```dart
    {{USER_BLOC_CODE_FOR_THIS_VIEW}} // Provide ONLY the BLoC(s) this specific view interacts with
    ```
4.  **View Requirements:** Describe the specific UI, layout, and functionality of `{{VIEW_NAME}}`. Detail how it should:
    * Display data from the BLoC state(s).
    * Use the specified external components listed below.
    * Handle BLoC states (loading, error, success) visually *within this view*.
    * Dispatch BLoC events based on user interaction *within this view*.
5.  **External Components Used in this View:** `{{USER_EXTERNAL_COMPONENTS_LIST_FOR_THIS_VIEW}}`

## Requirements for the View Output

* Generate the code for a **single Dart file** preferably named `{{view_name_lower_snake}}.dart`.
* The file must contain one primary `StatelessWidget` or `StatefulWidget` named `{{VIEW_NAME}}`.
* Use `BlocBuilder`/`BlocListener`/`BlocConsumer` to react to the provided BLoC(s).
* Import and use the specified external components correctly.
* Implement loading/error states visually (e.g., using `CircularProgressIndicator`, `Text('Error...')`).
* Add Dart doc comments (`///`).
* Assume necessary `BlocProvider`s are handled higher up in the widget tree.

**Generate the Dart code for the `{{VIEW_NAME}}` component ONLY.**
